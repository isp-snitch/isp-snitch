# ISP Snitch Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratification Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Last Amended Date:** 2024-12-19

## Project Mission

ISP Snitch is a lightweight ISP service monitor designed to help track outages and network issues from a local Mac. The project aims to generate accurate connectivity reports while running in the background using minimal resources, providing customers with data to support ISP performance claims.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Minimal Resource Footprint
The service MUST operate with minimal CPU, memory, and network overhead. Background monitoring MUST not impact system performance or user experience. Resource usage MUST be measurable and documented.

**Rationale:** Users expect background services to be invisible and non-intrusive. Excessive resource consumption undermines the tool's value proposition.

### Principle 2: Accurate Connectivity Reporting
All connectivity measurements MUST be scientifically accurate and reproducible. Network tests MUST use industry-standard protocols and methodologies. Data collection MUST include timestamps, latency measurements, and failure categorization.

**Rationale:** The primary value is providing credible data for ISP performance claims. Inaccurate data undermines user trust and legal standing.

### Principle 3: Modern Swift Architecture
The service MUST be built using modern Swift for both the background service and CLI components. Code MUST follow Swift best practices and leverage Swift's concurrency model for efficient background operations.

**Rationale:** Swift provides excellent performance, memory safety, and native macOS integration. Modern Swift concurrency enables efficient background processing.

### Principle 4: Homebrew Integration
The project MUST leverage Homebrew package management for underlying utilities and dependencies. Native system tools SHOULD be preferred over custom implementations when available.

**Rationale:** Homebrew provides a standardized way to manage dependencies on macOS. Reusing proven tools reduces maintenance burden and improves reliability.

### Principle 5: Multi-Access Interface
The service MUST provide both CLI and web interfaces. The web interface MUST be accessible via localhost and .local network addresses. Both interfaces MUST provide equivalent functionality for viewing reports.

**Rationale:** Different users have different preferences for accessing data. CLI users want scriptable access, while others prefer visual interfaces.

### Principle 6: Automatic Startup Integration
The service MUST integrate with macOS startup mechanisms to run automatically when the Mac starts. Installation MUST be seamless and require minimal user configuration.

**Rationale:** Continuous monitoring requires the service to start automatically. Users expect minimal setup friction for background services.

### Principle 7: Public Project Transparency
The project MUST be open source and publicly accessible. All development decisions, issues, and progress MUST be transparent to the community. Documentation MUST be comprehensive and accessible.

**Rationale:** Public transparency builds trust and enables community contributions. Open source allows users to verify the tool's accuracy and security.

### Principle 8: Data Privacy and Security
All network monitoring data MUST remain local to the user's machine unless explicitly shared. No telemetry or usage data MUST be transmitted without explicit user consent. Local data storage MUST be secure and encrypted.

**Rationale:** Network monitoring data is sensitive. Users must trust that their data remains private and secure.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
Constitution amendments require:
1. A detailed proposal explaining the change rationale
2. Community discussion period (minimum 7 days)
3. Consensus from project maintainers
4. Version increment following semantic versioning
5. Update of all dependent templates and documentation

### Versioning Policy
- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Backward incompatible changes to principles or governance
- **MINOR (X.Y.0):** New principles, expanded guidance, or new governance sections
- **PATCH (X.Y.Z):** Clarifications, wording improvements, or typo fixes

### Compliance Review
All project decisions, code changes, and documentation updates MUST be evaluated against these principles. Any deviation requires explicit justification and potential constitution amendment.

### Review Schedule
- Quarterly principle effectiveness review
- Annual governance structure assessment
- Ad-hoc reviews triggered by significant project changes

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Standards
- All code MUST include comprehensive tests
- Documentation MUST be updated with every feature addition
- Performance benchmarks MUST be established and maintained
- Security reviews MUST be conducted for all network-facing components

### Release Management
- Stable releases MUST be thoroughly tested on multiple macOS versions
- Beta releases MUST be clearly marked and include known limitations
- Security updates MUST be prioritized and released promptly

### Community Engagement
- Issues and feature requests MUST be acknowledged within 48 hours
- Pull requests MUST be reviewed within 7 days
- Community feedback MUST be incorporated into development decisions
- Regular project status updates MUST be provided to the community
