## Research Foundation

This implementation plan is based on comprehensive research and analysis:

- **Technical Research:** `research.md` - Architecture analysis, resource optimization, and connectivity testing methodology
- **Utility Validation:** `utility-analysis.md` - Real-world testing of ping, curl, dig, and speedtest-cli behaviors and output parsing
- **Swift 6.2 Analysis:** `swift62-packages-analysis.md` - Modern language features and package evaluation
- **Data Model Design:** `data-model.md` - Database schema and Swift data structures with Sendable conformance
- **Interface Contracts:** `contracts/` - CLI, web API, and system integration specifications
- **Implementation Tasks:** `tasks.md` - Detailed, dependency-ordered tasks for SPM-based development
