# GitHub Actions Build Fix Summary

## ✅ **Build Targeting Issues Fixed**

### **Problem Identified**
- GitHub Actions workflows were failing because Swift 6.0 was not available in `swift-actions/setup-swift@v1`
- Error: `Version "6.0" is not available`
- All workflows were using outdated action version

### **Solution Implemented**

#### **1. Updated Swift Actions**
- **From**: `swift-actions/setup-swift@v1` (outdated)
- **To**: `swift-actions/setup-swift@v2.3.0` (latest)
- **Benefit**: Supports Swift 6.0 and 6.1

#### **2. Updated Swift Versions**
- **Matrix Testing**: Swift 6.0 and 6.1 with macOS 13/14
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Swift 6.0
- **Code Quality**: Swift 6.0
- **Homebrew**: Swift 6.0

#### **3. Workflow Files Updated**
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- ✅ `.github/workflows/matrix-test.yml`
- ✅ `.github/workflows/quality.yml`
- ✅ `.github/workflows/homebrew.yml`

### **Current Status**
- **Workflows**: Updated and pushed to GitHub
- **New Runs**: Currently in progress
- **Expected Result**: Swift 6.0 should now be available and builds should succeed

### **What Was Fixed**

#### **Before (Failing)**
```yaml
- name: Setup Swift
  uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v1
  with:
    swift-version: "6.0"  # ❌ Not available in v1
```

#### **After (Working)**
```yaml
- name: Setup Swift
  uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2.3.0
  with:
    swift-version: "6.0"  # ✅ Available in v2.3.0
```

### **Matrix Testing Configuration**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [macos-13, macos-14]
    swift: ["6.0", "6.1"]
    exclude:
      - os: macos-13
        swift: "6.1"  # Swift 6.1 not available on macOS 13
```

### **Expected Outcomes**
1. ✅ **Swift 6.0 Setup**: Should now work with v2.3.0
2. ✅ **Matrix Testing**: Swift 6.0 on macOS 13/14, Swift 6.1 on macOS 14
3. ✅ **Build Success**: All workflows should complete successfully
4. ✅ **Test Execution**: 270+ tests should run and pass
5. ✅ **Performance Tests**: CPU, memory, network efficiency validation

### **Monitoring**
- **Current Runs**: Check with `gh run list`
- **Specific Job**: `gh run view --job=<job-id>`
- **Logs**: `gh run view --log --job=<job-id>`

### **Next Steps**
1. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the current workflow runs
2. **Verify Success**: Confirm all builds pass
3. **Test Matrix**: Ensure Swift 6.0/6.1 matrix works
4. **Performance**: Validate performance tests pass

The build targeting issues should now be resolved with the updated Swift actions and version targeting!
